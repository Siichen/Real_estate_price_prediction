## Real Estate Price Prediction Website

This data science project series walks through the step-by-step process of building a real estate price prediction website.

### Model Building with Sklearn and Linear Regression

We will start by building a model using sklearn and linear regression, utilizing the Bangalore home prices dataset from Kaggle.com.

### Python Flask Server

The second step involves writing a Python Flask server that utilizes the saved model to serve HTTP requests.

### Website Development

The third component is a website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can enter home square footage, number of bedrooms, etc. The website will then call the Python Flask server to retrieve the predicted price.

### Comprehensive Data Science Concepts Coverage

Throughout the model-building phase, we will cover various data science concepts, including data loading and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tuning, k-fold cross-validation, and more.

### Technology and Tools

This project covers a range of technologies and tools:

- Python
- Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
- Matplotlib for data visualization
- Sklearn for model building
- Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, and PyCharm as IDEs
- Python Flask for HTTP server
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript for UI
